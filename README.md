. Objective
Primary Goal: To create a functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
Secondary Goal: To practice fundamental programming concepts such as user input, control structures (e.g., switch statement), error handling, and console output in Java.

. Features and Functionality
User-Friendly Interface: The program prompts the user for input step-by-step, making it easy to follow.
Operation Menu: The program presents a menu with four arithmetic operations for the user to select.
Result Display: After performing the operation, the program displays a message with the result of the calculation

. Implementation Details
Input Handling: The program uses the Scanner class to read inputs from the console. It asks the user to enter two numbers and select an operation.
Control Structure: A switch statement is used to handle different operations based on user choice.
Error Handling:
Division by Zero: The program checks if the user attempts to divide by zero, displaying an error message if this occurs.
Invalid Choice Handling: If the user enters an invalid option (not 1-4), the program notifies them of the invalid choice.
Output: Each operation has a unique output format that clearly shows the calculation performed and the result.

. Technologies Used
Java: The entire application is written in Java, making use of basic Java syntax, control structures, and input/output methods.
IDE or Command-Line Interface: The program can be developed in any Java-supported IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or run via command-line.

Summary
This Basic Calculator project is a straightforward yet effective way to build programming skills in Java. It reinforces basic arithmetic logic, user input handling, control structures, and error management, making it a solid project for beginners and a foundation for building more advanced applications.
